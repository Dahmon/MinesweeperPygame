bugs:
[ ] _handleCellMouseUp not setting cell isBomb to false when bombRatio is 1

TODO:
[ ] 1. Optimize game, should be able to loop through all functions less times and pass the current cell to each function rather than looping in every one
	[x] Precalculate cell neighbouring bombs on bomb creation
[ ] 2. Holding both mouse buttons should clear area
	- Might do Ctrl + Mouse Left
[ ] Implement scaling, it is small
[ ] Fix positioning of displays to be inline with Face
[ ] Do not count own cell as bomb, for if ratio is set to 1
	- I would guess this happens because on first click, if it's a bomb it moves somewhere else and a new bomb is placed.
		The same cell is the only non-bomb cell, so might become a bomb again before set inactive
[ ] Fix Face class rect init
[x] Fix number rendering
	- How a new Surface is created and all digits are blitted onto it before being rendered on the screen
