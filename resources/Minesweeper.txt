Idea:

Bugs:
[ ] Scaling resets entire game
[ ] Face does not show :o when clicking on inactive cells

TODO:
[ ] 1. Optimize game, should be able to loop through all functions less times and pass the current cell to each function rather than looping in every one
	[x] Precalculate cell neighbouring bombs on bomb creation
	[ ] Simplify cells array by making 1 dimensional and give each cell a position property that would have been equal to the array indexes
[ ] 2. Holding both mouse buttons should clear area
	- Might do Ctrl + Mouse Left
[ ] Fix positioning of displays to be inline with Face
[ ] Should be able to reset game (when changing scale) and keep dialog open
[ ] Timer jumps forward in time when closing dialog, as we only prevent the display from updating not time from updating
[ ] Improve Modal to be generic Class with other classes positioned inside of
