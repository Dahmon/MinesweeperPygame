bugs:
[x] Neighbour mines function isInBounds
	Probably fixed by changing self.cells into multi dimensional array
[ ] _handleCellMouseUp not setting cell isBomb to false when bombRatio is 1
[x] On win screen, if hold drag sunglasses it will show death face
	- click anywheere actually. Might only apply when ratio is 0


TODO:
[ ] Holding both mouse buttons should clear area
[ ] Implement scaling, it is small
[ ] Fix positioning of seconds display
[ ] Do not count own cell as bomb, for if ratio is set to 1
[ ] Fix Face class rect init
[ ] Fix number rendering
